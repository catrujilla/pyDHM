pyDHM
=============

A Python library to numerically recover complex wave field information from Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) recordings.
The library includes among others:

Phase retreival from Image-plane and non image-plane recordings.
Numerical propagation of wavefields via three different propagators.
Phase compensation of the tilting angle in off-axis DHM (both diffraction-limited and non diffraction limited recordings) via three different approaches.
Phase Shifting methods for both in-line (3-step, 4-step and 5-step) and slightly off-axis acquisitions (quadrature phase shifting) and blind phase shifting methods (No known phase-shifts).
