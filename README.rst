pyDHM
=============

A Python library to numerically recover the complex wavefield information of samples from Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) recordings.
Among others, the library includes:

- Phase retrieval from image-plane and non-image-plane recordings.
- Numerical propagation of wavefields via three different propagators.
- Phase compensation of the tilting angle in off-axis DHM (diffraction-limited and non-diffraction-limited recordings) via three different approaches.
- Phase Shifting methods for both in-line (3-step, 4-step, and 5-step), slightly off-axis acquisitions (quadrature phase-shifting), and blind phase-shifting methods (No known phase-shifts).
